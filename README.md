# smartbar

smartbar is a sticky navbar/header that appears only when the user scrolls up developed originally for another project of mine: [defprogramming.com](http://defprogramming.com).

It is written in pure JavaScript and for now it has only two parameters: the header element and the offset start in pixels that will hide the header.

```javascript
smartBar.init(document.getElementById('smartbar'), 200);
```

## development

```bash
gulp
```
